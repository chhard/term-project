### Project Overview
This project utilizes **computer vision** to calculate vehicle speed on roads and count the number of vehicles crossing a specific point in real time.  
It aims to address traffic management challenges such as **traffic flow analysis**, **speed limit violation detection**, and **road condition monitoring**.

---

### Demo and Example
#### Example Output
A screenshot or video demonstrating real-time vehicle detection and counting can be added here.  
For example: *Vehicles are detected in real time, and those crossing a defined line are counted.*

### Dependencies and Required Files
This project requires the following:

#### Python Libraries
1. **OpenCV**
2. **NumPy**

#### YOLO Model Files
1. `yolov3.cfg`: YOLOv3 configuration file.
2. `yolov3.weights`: Pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file.
3. `coco.names.txt`: Text file containing class names.

These files can be downloaded from the official YOLO website or similar resources.

#### Input Video
An input video file (`video.mp4`) to analyze vehicle movements.

---

### How to Run
1. **Prepare YOLO Files**
   - Place `yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.weights`, and `coco.names.txt` in the project directory.

2. **Set Up Input Video**
   - Ensure that the input video (`video.mp4`) is located in the same directory or update the file path in the script.

3. **Run the Script**
   - Save the provided Python code into a file named `vehicle_detection.py`.
   - Execute the script using:
     ```bash
     python vehicle_detection.py
     ```

4. **View Results**
   - The system will process the video, detect vehicles, and count those crossing the defined line in real time.
